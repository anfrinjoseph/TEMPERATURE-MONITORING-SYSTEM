This project implements a temperature monitoring system using a PIC microcontroller and the LM35 temperature sensor, designed to provide accurate and real-time temperature readings. The LM35 sensor is a precision device that outputs a voltage linearly proportional to the temperature in Celsius, with a sensitivity of 10 mV per degree Celsius. The PIC microcontroller, equipped with a built-in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), reads the analog voltage output from the LM35 and converts it into a digital value. This digital representation of the temperature is then processed and displayed on a 16x2 LCD, allowing users to easily monitor temperature changes in their environment.

The system is designed for versatility and can be applied in various scenarios, including home automation, industrial monitoring, and environmental control systems. The user-friendly interface of the LCD provides clear visibility of the current temperature, updating at regular intervals to reflect real-time changes. Additionally, this project serves as an excellent introduction to interfacing sensors with microcontrollers, showcasing fundamental concepts in embedded systems design, such as ADC operation, data processing, and display interfacing. Overall, this temperature monitoring system is a practical demonstration of how to integrate hardware components to create a functional and informative application.
